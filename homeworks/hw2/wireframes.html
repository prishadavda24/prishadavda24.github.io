					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> Spotify </p>
							<img src="assets\imgs\number1.jpg" />
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> Spotify </p>
							<img src="assets\imgs\number2.jpg" />
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p>The goal of the Spotify website is to provide access to music and podcasts, create playlists, and access other people's playlists. Spotify is intended for music and podcast listeners. The design of the website caters to its listeners by having recently listened to playlists at the top and mixes Spotify creates at the top to keep you listening to the music you prefer. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p>A problem is that I have to scroll down to find mixes, artists, and playlists that cater to me. I personally use spotify for music more than podcasts, so I'd rather be reccommended music. I changed the order of the categories where the most used categories (ex. "Jump Back Into") would be at the top because I don't listen to shows that much. An algorithm can be made to change the order of the categories depending on how much users use it.</p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
