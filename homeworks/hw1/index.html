<p>Hi! I'm a ChemE major interested in clean energy. I love my major because it gives me the oportunity to work on impactful hands-on projects in teams. Right now, my goals in life are to get a job, become well rounded, get better at adulting, and become a better leader. I've learned that leading with vision and maintaining organization work well. I like to take random classes I'm interested in like PE classes and decals. I like to romanticize my life by associating moments with music. I love watching Bollywood movies and Indian stand-up comedy. I enjoy being with my friends. I like to journal and learn life lessons from my experiences. </p>

    <li>Something I learned from this article is to "develop your design eye" by observing and analyzing the design of apps and sites you use. For example, you can analyze word choice and which elements are highlighted and see how the design helps accomplish the goal of the website. </li>
    <li>My favorite part of this article were the examples. They were helpful because they included a specific observation and how the desing caters to the audience.</li>
    <li>"Next time you're sitting in a Lyft or waiting on a friend, open up an app and think through the reasons why the designers chose to design it that way."</li>
